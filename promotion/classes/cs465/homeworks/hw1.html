 <b><u>Reverse a number and Check if it is Prime or Not </b></u>: The goal of this program is to determine if the reverse of an input number from user prompt is prime or  not.

 <it>
 Write a series of MIPS statements by modifying the attached program <a href="http://www.cs.gmu.edu/~hrangwal/files/mips1_prime.asm">mips1_prime.asm</a>. Currently the 
 program  <b> mips1_prime.asm</b> accepts a number from the terminal and stores in $t0. Please add  sufficient statements to check if the reverse of input number is prime or not and print the following information:
 </it>
 </font>

 <code>
 Input: XYZ
 Reverse: ZYX 
 Prime: Yes or No (Based on the result)
 </code>

 <b> Examples and Test Cases: </b>
 <ol>
 <li> Input is 50. Then the program should print: 
 <code>
 Input: 50
 Reverse: 5 <font color="red"> (See the special handling of leading 0s). </font>
 Prime: Yes
 </code>
 </li>
 <li>
 Input: 25. Then the program should print: 
 <code>
 Input: 25
 Reverse: 52
 Prime: No
 </li>
 </ol>

 <b> Hints: </b>

 Study "mips1_prime.sm" to see how we can print statements in MIPS. You may need to use "div and divu" MIPS statements.

 <hr>

 <b> Deliverables:</b>
 <ol>
 <li> Modified Source Code: mips_prime1_XXX.asm where XXX is your "last names combined".
 <li> In the PDF file to be submitted for Part 2 include the following:
 <ol>
 <li> When the input is 7217. How many total instructions were executed? Report the number of R-type, I-type and J-type instructions. </li>
 <li> When the input is 31. How many total instructions were executed? Report the number of R-type, I-type and J-type instructions. </li>
 Hint: In MARS MIPS, you can use the tool Instruction Counter to determine the answers to the above questions.

 <b> Question 1. (20 points) </b> The following table shows results for SPEC CPU 2006 benchmark programs running on AMD Barcelona processor.
 <table border="1" bordercolor="grey"><tr><td> </td><td> Name </td> <td> Instruction Count x 10^9  </td><td> Execution Time (sec) </td><td> Reference Time (sec) </td></tr>

 <ul>
 <li> 1.a)  Find the CPI if clock cycle time is 0.333 nanoseconds (ns). </li>
 <li> 1.b) Find the SPECratio of each of the two benchmarks and the final "SPECratio" reported as a geometric mean. </li>
 <li> 1.c) Find the increase in CPU time for "bzip2" if the number of instructions are increased by 10% and the CPI is increased by 5% </li>
 <li> 1.d) Find the increase in CPU time for "go" if the number of instructions are increased by 10% without affecting CPI. </li>

 <b> Question 2. (15 points) </b>  The following table shows the number of instructions for a program.
 <table border="1" bordercolor="gray">
 <tr><td>Artih</td><td>Store</td><td>Load</td><td>Branch</td></tr>
 <tr><td>650 </td><td>200 </td><td>600 </td><td>150</td></tr>

 Answer the following questions:
 <ul>
 <li> 2.a) Assuming that arith instructions take 1 cycle, load and store 5 cycles, and branches 2 cycles. What is the execution time of the program in a 3.0 GHz processor ? </li>
 <li> 2.b) Find the global CPI for the program. </li>
 <li> 2.c) We can reduce the number of load instructions by  1/3 and the number of store instructions by 1/2. How much improvement (speedup) do we achieve in this new configuration ? </li>
