 <b><u> Phone Numbers </b> </u>: The goal of this program is to write a set of functions that computes the number of unique possible phone numbers based on the constraints below. Your code should be as efficient as possible and should use only the MIPS basic instructions.   

 <b> Constraints: </b>
 <ul>

 <li> Each valid phone number is only 7 in length. Only digits are allowed. </li>
 <li> A valid number does not begin with a 0 or 1. </li>
 <li> A valid number is one that can be traced by a sequence of knight movements on a phone keyboard (shown below)

 <b> Question 1. (15 points) </b> 

 Consider the following hypothetical MIPS instructions. 
 <ul> <li> A. <code> abs $t2, $t3    # R[rd] = | R[rs] | </code> </li>
 <li> B. <code> sgt $t1, $t2, $t3    # R[rd] = (R[rs] > R[rt]) ? 1.0 </li>
 </ul>

 Answer for each  of the two instructions.
 <ul>
 <li> 1.i)   Why are these instructions not included in the MIPS instructions set ?</li>

 <li> 1.ii)  Write the shortest sequence of MIPS instruction instruction to perform these operations.</li>

 <li> 1.iii) If these instructions, were implemented in MIPS which instruction format would you use and why  ? </li>
