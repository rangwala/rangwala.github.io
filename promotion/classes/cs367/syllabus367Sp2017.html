<caption> <b> About the Course </b> </caption>
<tbody><tr>
<th> Course Description </th></tr>
<tr>
<td>   This course provides an introduction to computer systems from a programmer's perspective. Topics include machine-level representation of data and programs, linking and loading, processes, virtual memory and dynamic memory allocation.  </td>
</tr><tr>
<th> Course Prerequisites </th></tr>
<tr>
<td>The prerequisites are automatically and strictly enforced.
<ul>
<li> Grade of C or better in CS 262 (or CS 222), and </li>
<li> Grade of C or better in ECE 301 or ECE 331 </li>
</ul></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th> Course Format </th></tr>
<tr>
<td>
Lectures will be lead by the instructor and will involve lots of interaction and in-class problem solving. Grading will be based on homeworks, projects, exams and in-class quizzes/participation. Homework assignments will require intensive programming and some will be auto-graded.  Exams and homework assignments must be done on an individual basis unless stated. Any deviation from this policy will be considered a violation of the GMU Honor Code.

<caption> <b> Policies: </b> </caption>
<tbody><tr>
<th> Attendance </th></tr>
<tr>
<td>Attendance is not compulsory but highly recommended for doing well in the class. This class has lots of active learning exercises, and they will be a lot of fun. 5% of your grade is for in-class quizzes and participation. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Homework/Project Submission </th></tr>
<tr>
<td>
Please ensure that the home-works and projects are submitted on-time. No late submissions are allowed. This is for your learning as  there are  several assignments and there may be dependencies amongst consecutive assignments.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th> Make-Up Exams &amp; Incompletes </th></tr>
<tr>
<td>
Make up exams and incomplete grades will not be given for this class.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Contested Grades </th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<ul>
<li> If you feel points have been incorrectly deducted, contact the grader. Tests: professor; homework/projects: GTA. </li>
<li> If you have not initiated contact within a week of receiving the grade (on BlackBoard or the lecture in which it was first handed out), it is too late. No grade-hunting in the last couple of weeks! </li>
<li> We strive to grade each student's work fairly and uniformly, often through specific test cases, which might even be automated as part of the grading process. </li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th> Computer Accounts</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Please obtain an <a href="http://labs.ite.gmu.edu/"> VS&amp;E labs </a> <span class="print-footnote">[6]</span> account. Even if you are using your own computer, your programs need to execute correctly on the Linux computers in the VS&amp;E lab since those systems will be used while grading your projects. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th> Academic Honesty and GMU Honor Code </th></tr>
<tr>
<td>You are expected to abide by the <a href="http://oai.gmu.edu/"> University's honor code </a> <span class="print-footnote">[7]</span> and the <a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/resources/honor-code/"> CS Department's Honor Code </a> <span class="print-footnote">[8]</span> and Academic Integrity Policies during the semester, i.e., collaboration between students in different groups on  an assignment is unacceptable. Any violation of the honor code will result in referral to the honor council with a recommendation that the student be awarded an F for the class.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th> Disability Statement </th></tr>
<tr>
<td> If you have a documented learning disability or other condition that may affect academic performance you should: 1) make sure this documentation is on file with the Office of Disability Services (SUB I, Rm. 222; 993-2474;http://ds.gmu.edu/)  to determine the accommodations you need; and 2) talk with me to discuss your accommodation needs. </td>
