%X The new generation of genomic technologies have allowed re-  searchers to determine the collective DNA of organisms (e.g.,  microbes) co-existing as communities across the ecosystem  (e.g., within the human host). There is a need for the com-  putational approaches to analyze and annotate the large vol-  umes of available sequence data from such microbial commu-  nities (metagenomes).  In this paper, we developed an ecient and accurate  metagenome clustering approach that uses the locality sen-  sitive hashing (LSH) technique to approximate the computa-  tional complexity associated with comparing sequences. We  introduce the use of xed-length, gapless subsequences for  improving the sensitivity of the LSH-based similarity func-  tion. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm on  two metagenome datasets associated with microbes existing  across dierent human skin locations. Our empirical results  show the strength of the developed approach in compari-  son to three state-of-the-art sequence clustering algorithms  with regards to computational eciency and clustering qual-  ity. We also demonstrate practical signicance for the de-  veloped clustering algorithm, to compare bacterial diversity  and structure across dierent skin locations.
